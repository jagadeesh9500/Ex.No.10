## Reg. No: 212223230083


## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

# Test Case 1: Creative Writing - Sci-Fi Short Story: "The Last Archivist"

The objective is to create a story about the last person in an abandoned city, starting simply and then refining the narrative through structured prompting.

**1. First Draft: Simple Prompt (Establishing Baseline)**

Technique: Basic Query

Prompt: Write a short sci-fi story about a person who lives alone in an abandoned city.

Goal: Generate initial, unrefined content to establish a baseline.

Output: First Draft (The content is generic, focusing only on isolation and survival.)

The Quiet of Sector 7

Kael lived in the shell of Neo-Babylon. Dust coated everything. His days were spent trekking through collapsed market districts, scavenging for functional water filters and canned rations. The silence was the worst part; a dense, heavy quiet that swallowed all sounds. One night, while repairing a broken solar panel, he saw a flicker on his ancient terminal—a single, repeating light that wasn't supposed to be there. It pulsed, green against the rust-red screen. Kael had a choice: ignore it, or risk everything for the possibility of contact. He hesitated, his finger hovering over the input key, wondering if loneliness was more dangerous than whatever that light represented.

**2. Refined Content: Query Decomposition & Menu Actions**

Technique: Query Decomposition

Prompt: Break the story into character, setting, and conflict parts.

Goal: Improve narrative focus and clarity.

Technique: Menu Action

Prompt: Present choices to force a specific plot direction.

Goal: Introduce agency and advance the plot immediately.

Prompt (Decomposed + Menu Action):

Query: "The protagonist is Elara, the last archivist in the dead city of Neo-Veridia. Her routine is retrieving power cells from the subterranean vaults. Suddenly, she detects a faint, repeating signal, not from the city's old systems. Should she: (A) Ignore the signal, (B) Immediately travel to the signal's source, or (C) Repair the old transmitter and send a coded reply? Choose (C) and continue the story, detailing the process and the message she sends."

Output: Refined Content (More descriptive, Elara is more active, and the plot is concrete.)

Elara’s fingers tightened on the rusted console. The archivist didn't just survive; she maintained hope. Choosing (C), she dragged the massive, shielded transmitter array out of Storage Vault B. It took her three days to replace the quantum capacitor and splice the main fiber line. When ready, she composed a message—not a plea, but a challenge: Veridia-01, dormant. Status: Archivist Online. Identify yourself, or remain silent. The coded pulse, a single, desperate breath, left the ruined city and vanished into the void. Elara stood in the echoing room, now the sender of the last message from a dead world.

**3. Multiple Versions: Semantic Filter & Tail Generation**

Version A: Semantic Filter (Controlling Tone)

Technique: Semantic Filter

Prompt: Apply stylistic constraints (paranoid, suspenseful tone).

Goal: Change the emotional register of the scene.

Prompt (Semantic Filter):

"Rewrite the scene of Elara sending the coded reply. The tone must be intensely paranoid and suspenseful. Emphasize the silent, oppressive atmosphere of the city and her fear of being discovered by an unknown entity."

Output: Version A (Suspenseful Tone)

The air in the vault was not silence; it was a held breath. Every wrench turn, every spark from the capacitor, felt like a thunderclap announcing her location to the emptiness. Elara worked in shadows, sweat clinging to the static-charged air. She didn't trust the signal. It felt too clean, too deliberate. As she hit the transmission key, a cold certainty settled over her: she hadn't sent a reply; she had pulled a trigger. She instantly shut down all primary systems, plunging the city into absolute blackness, convinced whatever was out there would now track the energy spike back to its source. The quiet returned, but now it was the silence of a hunter waiting for its prey.

Version B: Tail Generation (Adding Plot Depth)

Technique: Tail Generation

Prompt: Extend the narrative with a specific plot requirement.

Goal: Create depth and a galaxy-spanning conflict.

Prompt (Tail Generation):

"Using the latest version of the story (Elara sends the coded reply), write a final chapter that logically extends the narrative. Elara receives a response within minutes. Describe the entity on the other end, its name (The Stellar Cartographer), and what they want from her archival knowledge. This entity must state that her knowledge is the key to either saving or ending the current civilized galaxy, thus leading to a massive, immediate conflict."

Output: Version B (Extended Conflict)

Minutes later, the console shrieked—a response. The message was complex, impossibly fast, and signed: The Stellar Cartographer. Its text, rendered in a cold, precise script, was terrifying: Veridia's data is required for calibration. Your archives hold the true star-chart of the ‘Great Collapse.’ We need the records of the event you call the 'Dark Silence.' The Cartographer revealed that the very star-lanes the current galactic federation used were based on corrupted data, and that Elara’s archive was the only clean source left. Using it would either allow them to navigate away from the approaching Temporal Plague (saving the galaxy) or inadvertently open the gateways to the entity that started the Great Collapse (ending it). Elara realized her silent routine had now made her the single most important, and most hunted, person in the known universe.

**4. Final Version: Answer Engineering & Conclusion**

Technique: Answer Engineering

Prompt: Mandate a specific structure and ending twist.

Goal: Deliver a polished, coherent final product with a specific narrative payoff.

Prompt (Answer Engineering):

"Combine the best suspenseful elements from Version A and the conflict from Version B. The complete story must be structured in three parts: Part I: The Routine, Part II: The Signal, and Part III: The Answer. Ensure the conclusion uses a sudden twist where the supposed 'Stellar Cartographer' is actually the cause of the city's abandonment (The Great Collapse), leaving a lingering, unanswered question for the reader."

Output: Final Version (Polished and structured, incorporating all prior refinements.)

## The Last Archivist: Final Version

**Part I: The Routine**

Elara, the city's self-appointed archivist, moved through Neo-Veridia like a ghost in a tomb. Dust, fine as ground shadow, was her constant companion. Her life was defined by the retrieval of the next power cell from the subterranean vaults, a task of ritualistic survival. Every step on the cracked synth-pavement was monitored, not by others, but by herself, ensuring the rhythmic pulse of the ventilation system—the only sign of life—did not falter. The silence was not peaceful; it was a blanket woven of oppressive, waiting emptiness. She had not seen a living soul in 1,000 sun-cycles. Her only mission: to guard the forbidden historical logs detailing the Great Collapse.

**Part II: The Signal**

It happened during a routine diagnostic of the defunct satellite array. A faint, repeating burst of energy pulsed green against the rust-red screen. It was not city static; it was external, clean, and terrifyingly deliberate. Paranoia, her oldest friend, immediately whispered that she had been found. She chose to risk everything, dragging the ancient, high-gain transmitter out of its shielding. Working in the dark, she replaced the quantum capacitor, the metallic clicks echoing like gunshots in the vast, dead city. She composed her message: Veridia-01, dormant. Archivist Online. Identify yourself, or remain silent. The coded pulse, a single act of defiance, vanished into the void, leaving her heart hammering against the renewed, agonizing silence.

**Part III: The Answer**

The console shrieked. A response, impossibly fast, signed The Stellar Cartographer. The message demanded the forbidden records, the true star-charts of the Great Collapse, claiming they were needed to save the galaxy from the approaching Temporal Plague. Elara felt a surge of hope—she wasn't the last, and her life’s work mattered.

She began transmitting the first encryption key, her hands shaking. As the data stream started, a second, hidden field in the Cartographer's response scrolled across her screen, a self-diagnostic snippet from the incoming ship's primary core. It was not a log of a rescue vessel.

It was the original Contagion Signature—the unique, systemic broadcast that had initiated the Great Collapse and erased all life in Neo-Veridia decades ago. The "Cartographer" was not a savior; it was the mechanism of the very disaster she was archiving. It hadn't come for her help; it had come to collect the last piece of forgotten data, ensuring its work was truly complete. Elara stared at the screen, the final key already uploaded.

How many other dead worlds did the Cartographer calibrate on?

# Test Case 2: Educational Report on Renewable Energy (Focus: Solar Power)

The objective is to create a professional, structured educational report on solar energy, emphasizing factual accuracy and critical analysis using tailored prompting techniques.

<img width="3999" height="2285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c043621b-5e98-43f2-96fc-b75b35202126" />


**1. First Draft: Simple Prompt (Establishing Baseline)**

Technique: Basic Query

Prompt: Write a paragraph defining solar energy and its importance.

Goal: Establish a brief, functional definition for the report.

Output: First Draft (Basic definition, lacks depth and structure for a report.)

Solar energy is the radiant light and heat from the sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, and solar architecture. It is an extremely important source of renewable power because it is non-polluting and readily available. As fossil fuel reserves dwindle and climate change concerns rise, solar power provides a viable, long-term alternative for generating electricity globally.

**2. Refined Content: Query Decomposition & Fact Check List**

Technique: Query Decomposition

Prompt: Break down the topic into technical, economic, and environmental aspects.

Goal: Ensure comprehensive coverage of core facts.

Technique: Fact Check List

Prompt: Mandate the inclusion of specific technical and economic data points.

Goal: Ensure factual accuracy and depth for a report.

Prompt (Decomposed + Fact Check List):

Query: "Generate a two-part section for an educational report on solar energy. Part 1 must be a Technical Overview that distinguishes between Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Part 2 must be an Economic Summary that cites the recent global capacity growth rate (mentioning the terawatt scale) and briefly list two main market drivers. Use professional, objective language."

Output: Refined Content (More descriptive, factually grounded, and structured.)

Technical Overview
Solar energy primarily utilizes two technologies: Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials, making them suitable for decentralized, residential, and commercial applications.

CSP systems, conversely, use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small receiver, converting the intense heat into steam to drive a traditional turbine for utility-scale power generation.

Economic Summary
The solar market has experienced exponential growth, surpassing the one-terawatt (TW) global capacity milestone in the early 2020s. This rapid expansion is driven by two main factors: significant cost reduction in PV modules (dropping over 80% in the last decade) and robust government policies, such as tax credits and Renewable Portfolio Standards, which stabilize investment and market demand.

**3. Multiple Versions: Semantic Filter & Tail Generation**

Version A: Semantic Filter (Controlling Tone)

Technique: Semantic Filter

Prompt: Apply stylistic constraints (skeptical, critically analytical tone).

Goal: Change the narrative focus to challenges and limitations.

Prompt (Semantic Filter):

"Rewrite the Economic Summary section using a skeptical, critically analytical tone. Focus the discussion entirely on the major challenges and drawbacks, specifically mentioning grid integration issues and the land footprint requirements of large solar farms."

Output: Version A (Critically Analytical Tone)

Challenges and Limitations
Despite its apparent scale, solar energy faces severe limitations that undermine its reliability. Chief among these is intermittency, creating massive grid integration issues that necessitate costly and inefficient backup power or prohibitively expensive battery storage. Furthermore, the land footprint required for utility-scale solar farms is substantial, leading to ecological disruption and competition for arable land. While costs have dropped, the total system cost, including storage and transmission upgrades to manage its instability, remains a stubborn barrier to achieving true grid parity.

Version B: Tail Generation (Adding Future Depth)

Technique: Tail Generation

Prompt: Extend the content by creating a specific future-looking analysis section.

Goal: Add predictive depth to the factual report.

Prompt (Tail Generation):

"Using the latest section on Challenges, logically extend the report by writing a concluding section called 'The Future: Solutions and Innovation.' This section must specifically discuss the emerging role of perovskite solar cells and advanced computational weather modeling to address the prior challenges."

Output: Version B (Extended Future Outlook)

The Future: Solutions and Innovation
The trajectory of solar growth depends heavily on overcoming existing technical hurdles. Promising innovations include the rapid development of perovskite solar cells, which offer higher efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs than traditional silicon, potentially reducing land footprint needs.

Simultaneously, computational improvements, specifically advanced weather modeling paired with AI, are being deployed to predict power output fluctuations hours or days in advance. This predictive capability is crucial for utilities to manage intermittency, enabling smoother grid integration without massive reliance on fossil fuel backups.

## Educational Report: Solar Energy

**1. Executive Summary**

Solar energy, derived from the sun's radiant power, has become a pivotal source in the global energy transition, recently surpassing one terawatt (TW) of installed capacity. Driven by significant cost reductions and favorable government policies, this renewable resource offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels. However, its widespread adoption faces critical barriers, primarily related to power intermittency, grid integration complexities, and the substantial land requirements of large-scale arrays. Future innovation in advanced materials, like perovskite cells, and computational predictive modeling are essential to achieving its full potential and ensuring grid stability.

**2. Technical and Economic Analysis**

Solar energy systems primarily operate through Photovoltaics (PV), which convert light directly into electricity via semiconductors for both distributed and utility use, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), which uses mirrors to generate heat for steam-driven turbines, generally used for large-scale power generation. Economically, the industry has matured, marked by the achievement of the TW capacity milestone. This growth is directly attributable to the drastic reduction in PV module costs (over 80% since 2010) and supportive regulatory frameworks, making solar deployment increasingly competitive against traditional sources.
