## Reg. No: 212223230083


## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## OUTPUT:

✅ Test Case 1: Creative Writing – Fantasy Adventure Short Story: “The Ember Knight”

The new topic:
A fantasy story about the last fire knight guarding a dying volcano temple.

The objective is the same:
Start with a simple prompt → refine the story using advanced prompt patterns → create multiple versions → produce a final engineered narrative.

## 1. First Draft: Simple Prompt (Establishing Baseline)
Technique Used: Basic Query
Prompt:

Write a short fantasy story about the last fire knight guarding an ancient temple inside a dying volcano.

Goal:

Generate a baseline story—simple, unrefined.

Output: First Draft — “The Ember Fade”

Rhoan was the last Fire Knight of Ashpeak Temple. Once, the volcano had roared with life, its molten rivers feeding the sacred furnaces. Now only faint embers whispered in the dark. Rhoan spent his days tending the final flame, hoping it would not die under the suffocating ash.

One night, while stoking the forge, a strange glow flickered across the temple mirrors—an impossible shimmer of blue fire dancing along the cracked stone. It pulsed steadily, like a heartbeat. Rhoan approached cautiously. The dying volcano had spoken only in heat and rumble, never in cool azure light.

He hesitated. The temple’s teachings warned: Blue flame belongs to the Unseen.
Yet loneliness was heavier than fear.
Rhoan stretched out his hand.

## 2. Refined Content: Query Decomposition & Menu Actions
Technique 1: Query Decomposition

Break the story into clean narrative parts:

Character

Setting

Conflict

Technique 2: Menu Action

Provide choices → force the story to take a specific direction.

Prompt (Decomposed + Menu Action):

“The protagonist is Lyra, the last Ember Knight guarding the volcanic temple of Pyrestone. Her routine is harvesting heat fragments from the magma chambers. Suddenly, she detects a strange blue flame rising from the valley below—the color forbidden by the old prophecies.

Should she:
(A) Ignore it
(B) Descend immediately
(C) Attempt to summon an ancestral spirit using the blue flame residue

Choose (C) and continue the story, describing how she performs the ritual and the message she receives.”

Output: Refined Content — “Lyra and the Forbidden Flame”

Lyra steadied herself as the unnatural blue glow seeped into the temple’s vents. Choosing (C), she gathered the ancestral ashes and placed them in the summoning bowl. Her hands trembled as she whispered the Invocation of Spark—a ritual no Ember Knight had attempted since the First Eruption.

Cracks of sapphire flame spiraled upward, forming a wavering silhouette.
A voice—ancient, fractured—emerged:

“Pyrestone wanes. The last flame dies. The blue fire is not your enemy… it is the truth you were forbidden to see.”

The message ended with a final chilling command:
“Follow the blue.”

Lyra exhaled, realizing she had just broken the temple’s oldest law.

## 3. Multiple Versions: Semantic Filter & Tail Generation

Now we create alternate versions using two different techniques.

Version A: Semantic Filter (Controlling Tone)
Technique: Semantic Filter
Prompt:

“Rewrite Lyra’s summoning ritual scene with an ominous, paranoid tone. Emphasize her fear, the oppressive heat, and the dread that the blue flame may be alive.”

Output: Version A — Ominous Tone

The air should have been blistering, but cold crept along the stone like fingers. Every ash-grain crackled too loudly as Lyra mixed the ancestral powders. The blue flame throbbed behind her, casting long, twitching shadows.

She felt watched—scrutinized by something old, patient, and hungry.

When she struck the flint, the ritual bowl erupted in a silent burst. The flame’s shape twisted unnaturally, forming a face that seemed to stare straight into her fears.

Its whisper slithered through the chamber:
“Follow the blue… or be consumed by it.”

Lyra extinguished every torch instinctively, her heart rattling in her chest. The silence afterward felt predatory.

Version B: Tail Generation (Extending Plot Depth)
Technique: Tail Generation
Prompt:

“Extend the story. Lyra receives an immediate response after her ritual. Describe the entity—The Azure Seeker—and state what it wants: her Emberheart, the ancient core every Fire Knight carries. This Emberheart must be the key to awakening or destroying the entire volcanic realm.”

Output: Version B — Extended Conflict

The flame-mask dissolved, replaced by a new presence—a swirling column of blue fire that called itself The Azure Seeker.

Its voice was smooth, rhythmic, terrifyingly calm:

“Lyra of Pyrestone, your Emberheart burns with the last pure ember of this realm. Give it to me, and the volcano shall awaken anew. Refuse, and the Ember Cycle ends… all fire dies.”

Lyra touched her chest, feeling the Emberheart’s heat pulse beneath her armor.
To give it would resurrect the volcano…
But ancient texts warned that an awakened volcano could also raze the world.

The Seeker’s final words echoed:

“Life or ash. Choose.”

Lyra realized she had been thrust into a decision that could ignite or extinguish an entire civilization.

## 4. Final Version: Answer Engineering & Conclusion
Technique: Answer Engineering

Mandate a structure + introduce a twist.

Prompt:

“Combine the paranoia of Version A with the galactic-scale conflict of Version B. Structure the story in three parts:

Part I: The Dying Temple

Part II: The Blue Flame

Part III: The Truth

End with a twist: The Azure Seeker is actually the ancient entity that drained Pyrestone’s flames centuries ago, causing the volcanic realm’s downfall. Leave the ending ambiguous.”

Output: Final Version — The Ember Knight
The Ember Knight — Final Story
Part I: The Dying Temple

Lyra walked the hollow halls of Pyrestone Temple, feeling the volcano’s heartbeat weakening beneath her boots. Once a roaring titan of molten fury, Ashpeak was now a cooling tomb. The fading firelight cast feeble shadows along the cracked obsidian walls as she carried fresh heat fragments to the Ember Core.

Each day was quieter than the last.
Each night colder.
And Lyra was the final sentinel of a dying world.

Her Emberheart—glowing faintly beneath her armor—was the last true flame left.

Part II: The Blue Flame

The anomaly began as a faint blue shimmer crawling up the temple vents. The air chilled, unnatural in a fire-born sanctuary. Lyra’s pulse quickened; every instinct screamed that she wasn’t alone.

She performed the ancestral ritual in trembling paranoia, diving into forbidden magic. Blue fire spiraled upward, painting the chamber in icy dread.

A voice coiled out of the flame:

“Pyrestone falls. You cannot save it alone.”

The light thickened, forming a towering vortex—the Azure Seeker.

It spoke with chilling clarity:

“Your Emberheart is the key. Give it to me, and the fire world will awaken—or be erased.”

Part III: The Truth

As Lyra prepared the Emberheart key sequence, glyphs flickered unexpectedly across the summoning mirror—old archives unlocking themselves.

A buried truth emerged:
The Azure Seeker was not a savior.
It was the ancient devourer that stole Pyrestone’s fire centuries ago, draining the volcano and forcing the Fire Knights into extinction.

The Seeker hadn't returned for salvation.
It had come to finish consuming the final ember.

Lyra froze. If she refused, the volcano would die.
If she complied, the world might burn.

The chamber trembled. The Seeker leaned forward.

“Choose, Ember Knight.”

The flames dimmed—waiting.

And the story ended there, with no clear answer…
Only the last ember flickering in the dark.

The objective is to create a professional, structured educational report on solar energy, emphasizing factual accuracy and critical analysis using tailored prompting techniques.

<img width="3999" height="2285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c043621b-5e98-43f2-96fc-b75b35202126" />


**1. First Draft: Simple Prompt (Establishing Baseline)**

Technique: Basic Query

Prompt: Write a paragraph defining solar energy and its importance.

Goal: Establish a brief, functional definition for the report.

Output: First Draft (Basic definition, lacks depth and structure for a report.)

Solar energy is the radiant light and heat from the sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, and solar architecture. It is an extremely important source of renewable power because it is non-polluting and readily available. As fossil fuel reserves dwindle and climate change concerns rise, solar power provides a viable, long-term alternative for generating electricity globally.

**2. Refined Content: Query Decomposition & Fact Check List**

Technique: Query Decomposition

Prompt: Break down the topic into technical, economic, and environmental aspects.

Goal: Ensure comprehensive coverage of core facts.

Technique: Fact Check List

Prompt: Mandate the inclusion of specific technical and economic data points.

Goal: Ensure factual accuracy and depth for a report.

Prompt (Decomposed + Fact Check List):

Query: "Generate a two-part section for an educational report on solar energy. Part 1 must be a Technical Overview that distinguishes between Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Part 2 must be an Economic Summary that cites the recent global capacity growth rate (mentioning the terawatt scale) and briefly list two main market drivers. Use professional, objective language."

Output: Refined Content (More descriptive, factually grounded, and structured.)

Technical Overview
Solar energy primarily utilizes two technologies: Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials, making them suitable for decentralized, residential, and commercial applications.

CSP systems, conversely, use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small receiver, converting the intense heat into steam to drive a traditional turbine for utility-scale power generation.

Economic Summary
The solar market has experienced exponential growth, surpassing the one-terawatt (TW) global capacity milestone in the early 2020s. This rapid expansion is driven by two main factors: significant cost reduction in PV modules (dropping over 80% in the last decade) and robust government policies, such as tax credits and Renewable Portfolio Standards, which stabilize investment and market demand.

**3. Multiple Versions: Semantic Filter & Tail Generation**

Version A: Semantic Filter (Controlling Tone)

Technique: Semantic Filter

Prompt: Apply stylistic constraints (skeptical, critically analytical tone).

Goal: Change the narrative focus to challenges and limitations.

Prompt (Semantic Filter):

"Rewrite the Economic Summary section using a skeptical, critically analytical tone. Focus the discussion entirely on the major challenges and drawbacks, specifically mentioning grid integration issues and the land footprint requirements of large solar farms."

Output: Version A (Critically Analytical Tone)

Challenges and Limitations
Despite its apparent scale, solar energy faces severe limitations that undermine its reliability. Chief among these is intermittency, creating massive grid integration issues that necessitate costly and inefficient backup power or prohibitively expensive battery storage. Furthermore, the land footprint required for utility-scale solar farms is substantial, leading to ecological disruption and competition for arable land. While costs have dropped, the total system cost, including storage and transmission upgrades to manage its instability, remains a stubborn barrier to achieving true grid parity.

Version B: Tail Generation (Adding Future Depth)

Technique: Tail Generation

Prompt: Extend the content by creating a specific future-looking analysis section.

Goal: Add predictive depth to the factual report.

Prompt (Tail Generation):

"Using the latest section on Challenges, logically extend the report by writing a concluding section called 'The Future: Solutions and Innovation.' This section must specifically discuss the emerging role of perovskite solar cells and advanced computational weather modeling to address the prior challenges."

Output: Version B (Extended Future Outlook)

The Future: Solutions and Innovation
The trajectory of solar growth depends heavily on overcoming existing technical hurdles. Promising innovations include the rapid development of perovskite solar cells, which offer higher efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs than traditional silicon, potentially reducing land footprint needs.

Simultaneously, computational improvements, specifically advanced weather modeling paired with AI, are being deployed to predict power output fluctuations hours or days in advance. This predictive capability is crucial for utilities to manage intermittency, enabling smoother grid integration without massive reliance on fossil fuel backu


## Educational Report: Solar Energy

**1. Executive Summary**

Solar energy, derived from the sun's radiant power, has become a pivotal source in the global energy transition, recently surpassing one terawatt (TW) of installed capacity. Driven by significant cost reductions and favorable government policies, this renewable resource offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels. However, its widespread adoption faces critical barriers, primarily related to power intermittency, grid integration complexities, and the substantial land requirements of large-scale arrays. Future innovation in advanced materials, like perovskite cells, and computational predictive modeling are essential to achieving its full potential and ensuring grid stability.

**2. Technical and Economic Analysis**

Solar energy systems primarily operate through Photovoltaics (PV), which convert light directly into electricity via semiconductors for both distributed and utility use, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), which uses mirrors to generate heat for steam-driven turbines, generally used for large-scale power generation. Economically, the industry has matured, marked by the achievement of the TW capacity milestone. This growth is directly attributable to the drastic reduction in PV module costs (over 80% since 2010) and supportive regulatory frameworks, making solar deployment increasingly competitive against traditional sources.


## Conclusion:

By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.
